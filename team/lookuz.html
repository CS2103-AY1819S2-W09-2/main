<p>In light of the overwhelming workload of hospital administration teams due
to rising need for more and better healthcare services, we at
team W09-2 have designed and developed a desktop application that aims to
improve the hectic workload of hospital administrative staff by providing a
simple and efficient solution for managing requests for healthcare services
from home-stay patients: <strong>HealthHub</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>HealthHub is a desktop application built in Java and JavaFX that supports
both a Command Line Interface(CLI) and a Graphical User Interface(GUI),
providing the user with the flexbility to choose the mode of use that he or
she prefers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a member of the team tasked with the development of HealthHub, my role was
to design the command logic structure for parsing commands and inputs
entered by the user, as well as implementing the logic for commands
involving <code>HealthWorker</code> which represents the details of medical experts
register in HealthHub.</p>

<p><strong>Major Enhancements</strong>:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Implemented the logical structure for representing a person working in the
medical profession through the <code>HealthWorker</code> class.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Before health staff can be assigned to <code>Request</code> in HealthHub, there needs
to be a way for a person working in the medical profession to be represented
 in the system. Through my contribution in form of creation of the
 <code>HealthWorker</code> logic structure, this allows users to create a
 representation of medical workers in HealthHub</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When designing and implementing the <code>HealthWorker</code> class, one of the
considerations I had was to only maintain information necessary to the user such
 as the medical specialisations that the worker has, in order to reduce
 cluttering of information and keep the application simple and easy to use.
 With that in mind, the necessary</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reworked the <code>CommandParser</code> classes in HealthHub to facilitate the parsing
of inputs for commands involving both <code>HealthWorker</code> and <code>Request</code> objects.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Introduced the <code>CommandMode</code> class that differentiated the new design of
<code>CommandParser</code> from the original by allowing the same <code>CommandParser</code> class to
parse commands involving multiple different classes such as both
<code>HealthWorker</code> and <code>Request</code> classes, giving it more expressive power than
it&#8217;s original implementation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My contribution through the modification of the existing <code>CommandParser</code>
architecture paved the way for other team members to utilize the new reworked
<code>CommandParser</code> class for their individual contributions to HealthHub.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implemented the <code>add</code> command to facilitate the registering of a new health
staff through adding the represented <code>HealthWorker</code> class to HealthHub.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>For users to assign health staff to existing requests, the user needs to make
sure that the <code>HealthWorker</code> representation of the worker is already
registered in the HealthHub system for tracking and management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With this command, users can now register a new health staff into the
system by creating a representation of his/her details in HealthHub</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implemented the <code>edit</code> command to facilitate the registering of a new health
staff through modifying an existing <code>HealthWorker</code> object in HealthHub.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The ability to modify details of an existing <code>HealthWorker</code> allows the
user to update any outdated or incorrect information stored in HealthHub that
 may hinder the streamlining of handling requests by users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implemented the <code>delete</code> command to facilitate the registering of a new health
staff through removing the selected <code>HealthWorker</code> object to HealthHub.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The roster of health staff in a medical organization may change over time.
By adding the <code>delete</code> command, users now have the ability to remove medical
 staff that are no longer employed or available to handle requests.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added the functionality to filter <code>HealthWorker</code> objects in the HealthHub
system using various fields.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Through my implementation of the ability to filter the existing list of
<code>HealthWorker</code> in HealthHub, users are able to reduce their search for the
most appropriate health staff for assignment to requests to a shorter list
based on filter conditions they input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A significant difficulty that was faced when implementing this feature, is
the ability to combine multiple conditions of user inputs. The following
considerations and possible solutions for this problem are as follows:</p>

<td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">Using this method, all the conditions collected by the user through input
are parsed into <code>Predicate</code> equivalents.</p>
<p class="tableblock"> An <code>ArrayList</code> is then maintained that keeps all the parsed <code>Predicates</code>.
 During the filter process, the system uses the maintained list of
 <code>Predicate</code> to check for items that match the entire list of conditions</p>
<p class="tableblock"> <strong>Pros</strong>:</p>
<p class="tableblock"> Easy to manage all the conditions, as they are kept separate in a list and
 individual <code>Predicate</code> are easily managed.</p>
<p class="tableblock"> <strong>Cons</strong>:</p>
<p class="tableblock"> Limited expressiveness in implementing functions that use the <code>List</code> of
 <code>Predicate</code> due to the additional layer of abstraction provided by <code>List</code>.
 Even if a single condition is supplied, it must be wrapped in a <code>List</code> for
 standardization.</p></td>
<td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">Similar to using a List of <code>Predicate</code>, all user input conditions are
 first parsed into it&#8217;s <code>Predicate</code> equivalents.</p>
<p class="tableblock"> After this step, all the <code>Predicate</code> are composed into a single <code>Predicate</code>
 using the provided <code>and</code> method in the <code>Predicate</code> library in Java.</p>
<p class="tableblock"> <strong>Pros</strong>:</p>
<p class="tableblock"> Higher expressive power. The end result of the <code>and</code> function produces a
 <code>Predicate</code> which can be easily passed to function calls.</p>
<p class="tableblock"> <strong>Cons</strong>:</p>
<p class="tableblock"> No way to track individual conditions for additional granularity.</p>
<p class="tableblock"> I decided to go with this option as the expressive power of using the <code>and</code>
 function to compose multiple <code>Predicate</code> into a single one allows for other
 team members to use my implementation without having to understand any
 additional logic used if a <code>List</code> of <code>Predicate</code> were used instead, and also
  allows for future implementations to be more flexible in using just a
  <code>Predicate</code> rather than having to account for multiple <code>Predicate</code>.</p></td>
