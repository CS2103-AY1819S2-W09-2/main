By: `Team W9-02 (HealthHub)`      Since: `Jan 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources`. For Mac/Linux environments, run the command `./gradlew processResources` instead. It should finish with the [green]`BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

// tag::ui-header[]
[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui[UI Package]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `RequestListPanel`, `InfoPanel`, `HealthWorkerListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, etc.

All of these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the `UiPart` class, which is an abstract class containing methods for handling the loading of `FXML` files.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data dynamically.
// end::ui-header[]

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::modelUmlDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores the `Request` Book data.
* stores the `HealthWorker` Book data.
* Both `HealthWorkerBook` and `RequestBook` stores multiple previous states
in the form of `ReadOnlyHealthWorkerBook` and `ReadOnlyRequestBook`.
* A `UserPrefs` object denoting the user settings for the application.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we store a list of `Request` objects in `Request Book`, which stores the details of every request, including the patient's details, request date and status.
In addition, each `Request` also stores a `Set` of `Conditions` of the patient. +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

// tag::storage[]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Request, HealthWorker Book data in json format and read it back.

// end::storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

The `add`, `edit` and `delete` command have been tweaked to include addition of and `Request` and `HealthWorker`.

`CommandMode` Enum class was introduced in v1.1 to allow for `add`, `edit`
and `delete` different types of objects respective to the different
`CommandMode` Enums. The various `CommandMode` enums are:
** `CommandMode.HEALTHWORKER`
** `CommandMode.REQUEST`
** `CommandMode.OTHERS`
** `CommandMode.INVALID`

Each `CommandMode` enum is matched by it's own corresponding set of keywords,
 which are string equivalents of the enum counterparts that the user can
 input to specify the type of object he/she wishes to add. For example:

* The command string `add healthworker n/Dog Terr` that is entered by the
user contains the keyword `healthworker` after the `add` command word, which
is mapped to it's `CommandMode` equivalent in `AddCommandParser`.

The `CommandMode` enum also has a `Set<HealthWorker` field which contains
mappings from a set of keywords to it's respective `CommandMode` values for
translation of user input into it's corresponding `CommandMode` equivalents.

Then implementation for `CommandMode` is as follows:

```
public enum CommandMode {

    HEALTH_WORKER,
    REQUEST,
    OTHERS,
    INVALID;

    public static final String MODE_HEALTHWORKER = "1";
    public static final String MODE_REQUEST = "2";
    public static final String MODE_OTHERS = "4";
    public static final String MODE_INVALID = "5";

    private static final Set<String> healthWorkerModes = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList("healthworker", "h", "1"));
    private static final Set<String> requestModes = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList("request", "r", "2"));

    /**
     * Method that checks for the corresponding CommandMode given a string input.
     * Returns INVALID if input string does not match any of the given modes.
     */
    public static CommandMode checkMode(String input) {
        if (healthWorkerModes.contains(input)) {
            return CommandMode.HEALTH_WORKER;
        } else if (requestModes.contains(input)) {
            return CommandMode.REQUEST;
        }

        return CommandMode.INVALID;
    }
}
```

These `CommandModes` provide flexbility and functionality to switch between
 parsing of different `HealthWorker` and `Request` objects.

* Each of the `add`, `edit` and `delete` command is eventually parsed through
 the `AddCommandParser`, `EditCommandParser` and `DeleteCommandParser`
 classes respectively, which returns an `AddCommand`, `EditCommand` and
 `DeleteCommand` object respectively.

=== Add feature

The `add` command allows for users to register new `HealthWorker` and
`Request` objects into HealthHub.

The format for the `add` command is as follows:

`add <keyword> <parameters>...` +

When the user inputs an `add` command, the `add` command is eventually passed
 into an `AddCommandParser` object that handles the argument fields after the
  `add` keyword in the command.

The `AddCommandParser` first checks the first keyword in the string for a valid
`CommandMode` string equivalent. if the keyword does not contains a valid
string representation of any `CommandMode` enum, then a `ParseException` is
thrown by the `AddCommandParser`. This initial sequence of steps is also
repeated in the following `EditCommandParser` and `DeleteCommandParser` objects.

After checking for valid keyword, the `AddCommandParser` object checks for
the following compulsory information, along with regular expressions checking
 for validity of each field:

==== Adding a `HealthWorker`

Format: `add healthworker/h/1 <parameters>...` +

* `name` field prepended by the `n/` prefix. Valid inputs of `name` field
will be represented and stored as a `Name` class object.
** `name` field can only contain alphanumeric characters, and cannot be an
empty string.
* `phone` field prepended by the `p/` prefix. Valid inputs of `phone` field
will be represented and stored as a `phone` class object.
** `phone` contains only 8 numeric digits, of which the first must start with
 a 6,8 or 9.
* `nric` field prepended by the `i/` prefix. Valid inputs of `nric` field will
be represented and stored as a `Nric` class object.
** `nric` field must contains a 9 character string, starting with either a S
or T, followed by 7 numeric digits and a alphabet letter. All letters used
must be capitalized
* `organization` field prepended by the `o/` prefix. Valid inputs of
`organization` field will be represented and stored as a `Organization` class
object.
** The `organization` field must contain only alpha numeric characters, and
contain at least 2 characters.
* `specialisation` field prepended by the `s/` prefix. All valid
`specialisation` fields will be parsed into it's respective `Specialisation`
enum equivalent, collected and stored as a `Set<Specialisation>` in the
`Skills` class object.
** The values in  the `specialisation` field will be only be accepted if
they correspond to specific mappings to an existing `Specialisation` enum that
are registered in HealthHub. For information on the valid Specialisation
mappings, visit <appendix for Specialisation num>

`AddCommandParser` first checks for the presence of the prefixes for each of
the compulsory fields mentioned above. If any of them are missing, or if any
invalid fields as per the conditions mentioned above, then the
command is invalid and a `ParseException` is thrown.

If the keyword denoted maps to `CommandMode.HEALTHWORKER`, then
`AddCommandParser` constructs a `HealthWorker` object representing the health worker that is
just added with the respective `Name`, `Phone`, `Nric`, `Organization` and
`Skills` objects parsed from the user input, and returns an `AddCommand`
contain the constructed person to be added.

[NOTE]
====
If multiple fields of the same prefix are added, the last value of the last
field will be the one accepted for all fields except the `specialisation` field.
====

Upon a successful `add` command, the new `HealthWorker` or `Request`
constructed from the user entered fields will be added to the end of the `UniqueHealthWorkerList`.

===== Valid Specialisations

The `Specialisation` field is an `Enum` type in Java, and supports only the
enum fields that are specified in the `Specialisation` class itself.

The implementation of the `Specialisiation` class is as follows:

```
public enum Specialisation {

    GENERAL_PRACTICE,
    CARDIOLOGY,
    ENDOCRINOLOGY,
    NEUROLOGY,
    ORTHOPAEDIC,
    PAEDIATRIC,
    GYNAECOLOGY,
    UROLOGY,
    PATHOLOGY,
    HAEMATOLOGY,
    PHYSIOTHERAPY,
    OCCUPATIONAL_THERAPY,
    ANAESTHESIOLOGY;

    public static final String MESSAGE_CONSTRAINTS = getMessageConstraints();

    /**
     * Displays a list of available specialisations.
     * @return String describing all available specialisations.
     */
    public static String getSpecialisationList() {
        StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
        for (Specialisation specialisation : Specialisation.values()) {
            stringBuilder.append(specialisation.toString()).append("\n");
        }

        return stringBuilder.toString();
    }

    /**
     * Checks if a given input string matches any of the available
     * Specialisations
     * @param input string to check for valid Specialisation.
     * @return true if the input string has a matching Specialisation, else
     * false.
     */
    public static boolean isValidSpecialisation(String input) {
        try {
            Specialisation.valueOf(input);
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException | NullPointerException e) {
            return false;
        }

        return true;
    }

    /**
     * Returns the corresponding matching Specialisation given an input String
     * @param input string to match Specialisations.
     * @return Specialisation matching the given string.
     */
    public static Specialisation parseString(String input) {
        return Specialisation.valueOf(input);
    }

    /**
     * Returns an Optional containing the matching Specialisation to the substring if any, else an empty Optional
     * @param input the substring to match against the Specialisation names
     * @return Optional containing the matching Specialisation, else an empty Optional
     */
    public static Optional<Specialisation> getSpecialisation (String input) {
        if (input.isEmpty()) {
            return Optional.empty();
        }

        for (Specialisation specialisation : Specialisation.values()) {
            if (specialisation.name().toLowerCase().contains(input.toLowerCase())) {
                return Optional.of(specialisation);
            }
        }

        return Optional.empty();
    }

    /**
     * Formulates the String representing the valid specialisations and
     * constraints.
     * @return String containing the valid specialisations to be added.
     */
    private static String getMessageConstraints() {
        StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
        stringBuilder.append("Valid specialisations: \n");
        stringBuilder.append(getSpecialisationList());

        return stringBuilder.toString();
    }

}

```

==== Adding a Request


==== Current Implementation
The `add request` command allows the `LogicManager` to create a new request and add it to the list of requests. Adding a new request requires the
patient's name, patient's phone number, patient's address, patient's NRIC number and the patient's conditions. The format of the add request command is
add request n/NAME p/PHONE i/NRIC a/ADDRESS dt/DATETIME c/CONDITION.

The following sequence shows the sequence when the add command is execute by the LogicManager:

image::addrequest.png[width=800]
Figure 3.1.3.1 Sequence Diagram for `add request` command

From the diagram above:

.  `LogicManager`'s execute is called when the administrator keys in `add request` and it calls upon `parseCommand` of `HealthHubParser` to parse the command
.  `HealthHubParser` will initialize `AddCommandParser` and invoke the method `parse` to further parse `request` command
.  `parse` will be invoked and passed the parameters of the add command.
.  If all the arguments of the `add` commands are valid, `AddRequestCommand` will be returned to the `LogicManager`
.  `LogicManger` will then calls the method `execute` method of `AddRequestCommand`
.  `AddRequestCommand` will call `addRequest` passing `Request` as an argument to `Model` and after calls `commitRequestBook` method from `Model`
.  A `CommandResult` will be returned at the end.

==== Design Consideration
===== Aspect: Data Structure for the list of Requests
* **Alternative 1 (Current Approach):** Using a `UniqueRequestList`
** Pros: The comparison is not as rigid. You can create requests with similar names/phones as long as it passes a less stringent criteria.
** Cons: You need additional overhead. You need to create an extra class and function to check.

* **Alternative 2:** Using a `Set`
** Pros: Do not need an extra function. You can use use `equals` for comparison
** Cons: It is a strict check and as a result you will not be allowed to create requests with same phone/same name etc.

===== Aspect: Data Structure of `Request`
* **Alternative 1 (Current Approach):** All parameters in `Request` are abstracted out to have a class of its own (with the exception of the HealthWorker).
** Pros: It adheres to the Single Responsibility Principles (SRP) and the Separation of Concerns (SoC) as each parameter checks whether it is valid
** Cons: Many different classes are created which increases the complexity of the code

* **Alternative 2:** Store all parameters of `Request` as `String`
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Violates SRP as one single class will need to check if the arguments are valid.

[NOTE]
The `RequestStatus` class within the `Request` object utilises the Java `Enum` to ensure type safety in user inputs.

The implementation of the `RequestStatus` class is as follows:

```
    private enum Status {
        PENDING,
        ONGOING,
        COMPLETED
    }

     public RequestStatus(String status) {
         this.requestState = Status.valueOf(status);
     }

     public RequestStatus() {
         this(Status.PENDING.name());
     }
```

Through this, any user String that is passed in as an argument for the `RequestStatus` field is automatically type checked,
ensuring that there are no invalid request statuses entered.


=== Edit feature

The `edit` command allows users to modify details of existing `HealthWorker`
or `Request` objects should the information need to be updated.

The format for the `edit` command is as follows:

`edit <keyword> <index> <parameter> [<parameter>]...` +

Similar to the `add` command, the `edit` command arguments are first checked
passed into the `EditCommandParser` class instance, where it evaluates for a
valid first keyword and argument prefixes and values. Additionally, the
`<index>` field is also checked against the existing list of `HealthWorker`
or `Request` to ensure that the provided `<index>` is a valid `<index>` in
the list.

The argument field after the first keyword denoting the specified
`CommandMode` must not be empty, and must contain at least one valid prefix
and a valid value for the respective field to be edited. The prefixes and
validity follows the same conditions as stated in the `add` command.

[NOTE]
=====
Similar to the `add` command, only the last value will be accepted for fields
 with the same prefixes.

If any `specialisation` fields are entered, the current `Skills` object of
the `HealthWorker` object being edited will be entirely replaced by a new
`Set` of `Specialisation` that corresponds to valid `specialisation` fields
enteed by the user.
=====

==== Editing `HealthWorker`

Upon parsing the argument string into `EditCommandParser`, it first checks
that the `<index>` field provided is non-negative, and not greater than the
size of the `UniqueHealthWorkerList`.

After checking for a valid `CommandMode.HEALTHWORKER` keyword after the
`edit` command word, `EditCommandParser` then tokenizes the argument string
after the keyword into a `ArgumentMultiMap` object that stores the prefix to
values mapping for each field specified. If no prefixes, or invalid prefixes
are specified, or if invalid values for any prefix is input, then
`EditCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`, and displays an error message
to the terminal.

If all values specified are valid and at least one field to specify is
provided, the `EditCommandParser` parses the `ArgumentMultiMap` containing
the values to be updated and it's respective prefixes into an
`EditHealthWorkerDescriptor` object. `EditCommandParser` then passes the
`EditHealthWorkerDescriptor` and the `HealthWorker` object fetched from the
`HealthWorkerBook` using the specified valid `<index>` into a
`EditHealthWorkerCommand` object and returned.

In the `EditHealthWorkerCommand`, each `HealthWorker` related field prefix is
checked for it's value in `EditHealthWorkerDescriptor`, and if a value
exists, it replaces the current value of the corresponding field in the
`HealthWorker` object. Else, the field in `HealthWorker` is unchanged.

Upon a successful `edit` command, the `HealthWorker` or `Request` object that
 has had it's fields edited will immediately reflect the changes in details on
  the GUI.

=== Delete feature

Using the `delete` command, the user can remove `HealthWorker` and `Request`
objects from the system.

The format for the `delete` command is as follows:

`delete <keyword> <index>` +

The `delete` command takes in only two arguments after the `delete` command
word: the `<keyword>` corresponding to the respective `CommandMode` enum, as
well as the `<index>` of the `HealthWorker` or `Request` object to be
deleted, as indicated in the `UniqueHealthWorkerList` or `UniqueRequestList`
displayed in the GUI.

The `<index>` entered by the user is one-based, while it is converted to it's
 zero-based format in HealthHub during the deletion process. This ensures
 that non-technical people who use HealthHub do not need to adjust to
 zero-based indexing, and can continue using one-based indexing which they
 are more familiar with.

If the user enters an invalid `<index>` field, such as a negative index or an
 index that is greater than the size of the `UniqueHealthWorkerList` or
 `UniqueRequestList`, then a `ParseException` will be thrown, and an error
 message will be displayed to the user.

Upon successful `delete` of a valid `HealthWorker` or `Request`, the removed
entity will be immediately reflected on the GUI, and be removed from view.


// tag::assignrequest[]
=== Assign Request feature

The assign request feature allows an administrator to assign a request to a particular healthworker.

==== Current Implementation

The following sequence diagram shows the sequence flow from the `LogicManager` to the `ModelManager` when a user enters a `assign request` command:

image::assignreq.png[width=800]
Figure 3.3.1.1 Sequence diagram to illustrate `Logic` component interactions for `assign request` command.

image::assignreq1.png[width=800]
Figure 3.3.1.2 Sequence diagram to illustrate `Logic` and `Model` component interactions for [blue]`AssignRequestCommand`.

1. When `LogicManager` receives the `execute` command, it calls the `parseCommand` method in `HealthHubParser`.
2. `HealthHubParser` will receive `assign` as the command and instantiate `AssignRequestCommandParser` to further parse the command.
3. If the arguments specified in the `assign` command are invalid, a `AssignCommand` will be created and returned back to the `LogicManager`.
4. `LogicManager` will proceed to call the `execute` command of `AssignCommand`
5. `AssignRequestCommand` will proceed to call the `getFilteredRequestList` method of `Model`.
6. Iterate through the `requestIds`, if valid, add the `request` corresponding to that `index` to the set of `Request`.
7. Writes the updated request to the `RequestBook` in `ModelManager`

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Implementation of the `AssignRequestCommand` feature
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Index-based assigning, where the user assigns a request based on the index number of that list item they see in the UI.
** Pros: Effecient - since the storage of `HealthWorker` and `Request` are in lists, index-based assigning optimises effeciency, by reducing runtime to O(1) time.
** Pros: Simple to implement, `Request` and `HealthWorker` details can easily be retrieved from the `filteredRequestList` and `filteredHealthWorkerList` in `ModelManager`.
** Cons: May not be very user friendly as index-based assigning may not be intuitive. (This has been circumvented by using 1-based indexing, instead of the traditional 0-based indexing).

* Alternative 2: Assign by making a query using another unique identifier, like the name or NRIC of the patient and healthworker.
** Pros: Perhaps more user friendly, as the commands are more straightforward to pick up.
** Cons: Not effecient, as each query would run in O(n + m) time, where n is the number of requests and m is the number of healthworkers.
Although this can be further optimised by using other data structures like a Balanced Binary Search Tree (Java `TreeSet`)
 (to add while maintaining some ordering), the cost of eventually filtering it to display to the user would still run in O(n + m) time.

===== Aspect: Relationship between `Request` and `Healthworker`
* Alternative 1 (current choice): The `Request` holds only some of the details of the healthworker (e.g name) assigned to it.
** Pros: Simplification of implementation.
** Pros: Cleaner implementation, low level of dependencies on other modules. This also makes it easier to test, and easier to maintain.
** Cons: Makes it difficult to obtain all details of a `HealthWorker` from a `Request` object.

* Alternative 2: The `Request` holds a `HealthWorker` object and the `HealthWorker` keeps track of a list of `Request`s.
** Pros: Can quickly access details of a `HealthWorker` from a `Request`, and can quickly access the `Requests` assigned to a `HealthWorker` from the `Request`.
** Cons: Increases coupling by adding additional dependencies to the code. This makes the code base more difficult to maintain.

// end::assignrequest[]
=== List Feature
The `list` command allows the user to be able to display all `HealthWorker`
or `Request` objects stored in the current application.

==== Listing `HealthWorker` objects
* Format: `list healthworker/h/1`
* Displays all `HealthWorker` objects already stored in the current
application, and the following details:
** `name` - Name of the `HealthWorker`
** `nric` - NRIC of the `HealthWorker`
** `organization` - Organization of the `HealthWorker`
** `skills` - Skills and Specialisations that the `HealthWorker` object
possesses

==== Listing `Request` objects
* Format: `list request/r/2`
* Displays all `Request` objects already stored in the current
application, and the following details:
** `name` - Name of the patient that made the request in `Request` object.
** `address` - Address of the patient
** `condition` - Condition of the patient that made the request.

=== Filter Feature

With the filter command, users can provide specific parameters that act as
conditions for HealthHub to filter the `UniqueHealthWorkerList` and
`UniqueRequestList` by. Using these parameters, HealthHub displays only the
`HealthWorker` or `Request` whose fields contains the specified parameters.

Command Format: `filter <keyword> <prefix>/<parameter> [<prefix>/<parameter>]
...`

[NOTE]
====
The `<prefix>` and `<parameters>` specified in the command descriptions
below follow the same valid prefix and parameter formats as the `add`, `edit`
 and `delete` commands
====

==== Filtering `HealthWorker`

The command format for filtering `HealthWorker` is:

`filter healthworker/h/1 <prefix>/<parameter> [<prefix>/<parameter>]...`

The fields in `HealthWorker` that the user can filter by are:

* `name` prepended by `n/` prefix
* `organisation` prepended by the `o/` prefix
* `specialisation` prepend by the `s/` prefix

[NOTE]
====
If multiple `specialisation` fields are provided, HealthHub will filter the
`UniqueHealthWorkerList` by displaying `HealthWorker` that contains both
specified `specialisations
====

HealthHub filters the respective list of `HealthWorker` and `Request` by
checking if the corresponding field contains the specified parameter as a
substring. +
For example entering the command `filter h n/John` displays a list of
`HealthWorker` whose name equals to John, or contains John as a substring(E.g
 Johnny, Johnson).

// tag::filterHealthWorker[]
==== Filtering `HealthWorker`

The `filter` command allows users to display only `HealthWorker` or `Request`
 whose fields matches the `<parameter>` specified in the filter command.

Format: `filter healthworker/h/1 <prefix>/<parameter> [<prefix/<parameter>]
...`

* The `filter` command checks for `HealthWorker` whose field specific to the
`<specific>` contains or matches the `<parameter>` provided.
* Example: `filter h n/John` changes the UI to display only `HealthWorker`
whose name is John, or contains John (Johnny, Johnson, ...)

Upon entering the `filter` command, the `filter` command word is stripped from the
 input and the argument fields are passed into the `FilterCommandParser` class.
The regular expressions for checking the fields for `name`, `organisation`
and `skills` follows the same format as mentioned in `add` command. If
invalid parameters are specified by the user, or if an invalid `keyword` was
specified that does not correspond to any `CommandMode` enum, then
`FilterCommandParser` throws a `ParseException` and displays an error message
 to the user.

If valid inputs are provided, `FilterCommandParser` tokenizes the argument
string without the `keyword` using `ArgumentTokenizer` object, mapping each
parameter to it's respective prefix in an `ArgumentMultiMap` object.
`FilterCommandParser` then creates a `Predicate` object using the parameter
values in `ArgumentMultiMap` for each filter condition, and composes them
into a single `Predicate` using the `and` function in `Predicate` in
conjuction with `stream` and `reduce` methods from Java's `Function` library.
 The `Predicate` object composed is then passed into
 `FilterHealthWorkerCommand`, which sets the predicate for the `HealthWorker`
  list in the GUI to display only `HealthWorker` whose fields matches the
  `Predicate` set.

===== Design Considerations

During the implementation of the `filter` command, we decide between two
alternative implementations of managing the `Predicates` created from
multiple criteria input by the user.

The following table states the considerations for performance as well as
future implementations and enhancements to HealthHub that were taken into
account:

// tag::filterHealthWorkerTable[]
[width="100%",cols="1, 5, 5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Design
| Using a `List` of `Predicate`
| Composed `Predicate` using `and` method

| How it works
| Each user input condition will be parsed into `Predicate`,
which are stored in an `List`.
*Pros*: Easier to manage each single `Predicate` as they are kept separate
*Cons*: Need to rework existing GUI implementation for `filter` as it only
uses a single `Predicate` Object
| Each user input will be parsed into a `Predicate` object, and all the
`Predicate` formed will be composed into a single `Predicate` object.
*Pros*: Ease of existing and future implementations as functionality only
depends on `Predicate`
*Cons*: Unable to specify actions for each `Predicate`

| Implementation
| User inputs are first parsed into `Predicate` equivalents,
and then added to an `ArrayList`. `FilterCommandParser` then takes the
existing `UniqueHealthWorkerList`, checks for `HealthWorker` whose fields
matches the list of `Predicate` using `allMatch` method from the `Predicate`
library, and then returns an `ObservableList` containing those `HealthWorker`.
| User inputs are parsed into `Predicate` equivalents, which are then composed
into a single `Predicate` containing the logic of all the composed
`Predicates` using the `and` method from `Predicate` library. The composed
`Predicate` is then set as the filter condition into the existing
`ObservableList` of `HealthWorker` in the UI component.

|=======================================================================
// end::filterHealthWorkerTable[]

Ultimately, the decision was made to implement the `filter` command by
composing the `Predicate` that were formed from the user inputs into a single
 `Predicate` using a combination of Java's `Function` library methods
 `stream` and `reduce`, as well as the `and` method used in Java's
 `Predicate` library. +
This is because maintain a `List` of `Predicate` in HealthHub requires an
unnecessary rework of many existing components in HealthHub in order to fit
the new implementation of using a `List`, such as replacing `Predicate` in
methods involved with `List<Predicate>`.

In addition, by returning a single `Predicate` object, ease of implementation
 of methods in `filter` command, as well as any future or existing
 enhancements to `filter` reduces the complexity of code as the function
 needs only to depend on `Predicate` and not `List`, hence observing the Law
 of Demeter.

===== Current Implementation

The following sequence diagram shows the flow of events when the `filter h
s/physio` command is entered by the user to display only `HealthWorker`
objects that possess expertise in physiotherapy:

image::FilterHealthWorkerSD.png[width=800]
Figure 3.6.1.1: Sequence diagram illustrating the interactions between the
`Logic` and `Model` components when `filter` command is called.

. When the user inputs the full command `filter h s/physio`, the
`LogicManager` object takes in the command string, and passes it into
`HealthHubParser` using the `parseCommand` method.
. `HealthHubParser` identifies the command word in the input string, which is
 `filter`, and identifies the appropriate `CommandParser` object to parse the
  user command.
. `HealthHubParser` strips the `filter` command word off the user input, and
passes the remaining argument string in to a new `FilterCommandParser` object
 as corresponding to the `filter` command word.
. `FilterCommandParser` then checks for a valid `CommandMode` that
corresponds to the first keyword in the argument string. In this case, the
keyword `h` corresponds to the `CommandMode.HEALTHWORKER` value.
`FilterCommandParser` then creates a `FilterHealthWorkerCommand` with the
`Predicate` constructed from the fields remaining in the argument string. For
 full detail on the implementation of the `FilterCommandParser` logic, see
 the sequence diagram in figure 3.6.1.2 below.
. `FilterCommandParser` returns the `FilterHealthWorkerCommand` object to
`HealthHubParser`, which calls the `execute` method of
`FilterHealthWorkerCommand`.
. `FilterHealthWorkerCommand` uses Java 8's `Predicate` and `Function`
libraries to condense all the supplied `List<Predicate>` into a single
`Predicate` using the `and`, `reduce` and `stream` method calls. After which,
 it calls the `updateFilteredHealthWorker` method in `Model` to set the
 condensed `Predicate` on the `UniqueHealthWorkerBook` in `Model`, displaying
  only the `HealthWorker` that evaluates the set `Predicate` to true on the GUI.

within the `FilterCommandParser` class when it's `parse()` method is called.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature

==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedBook`.
There are two extensions of it. `VersionedHealthWorkerBook` extends `HealthWorkerBook` and `VersionedRequestBook` extends `RequestBook`.
Both contain an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `healthWorkerBookStateList` or `requestBookStateList`
 and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedBook#commit()` -- Saves the current request/healthworker book state in its history.
* `VersionedBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous request/healthworker book state from its history.
* `VersionedBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone request/healthworker book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commit()`, `Model#undo()`
and `Model#redo()` respectively.


The feature also makes use `ModifyCommandHistory` to keep track of the commands that modified the books. It contains
`currentStatePointer` and a list of `CommandType` enums to differenciate the type of command to undo or redo.
Similar to `CommandMode`, the various `CommandType` enums are:

** `CommandType.HEALTHWORKER_COMMAND`
** `CommandType.REQUEST_COMMAND`



Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedRequestBook` and `VersionedHealthWorkerBook` will be initialized with the initial state,
 and the `currentStatePointer` for each `VersionedBook` pointing to that single book state.
Since no modify command has been called, the initial list of commands in `ModifyCommandHistory` is empty and the initial `currentStatePointer` of `ModifyCommandHistory` is initialized to -1.

image::initrb.png[width="800"]
image::inithb.png[width="800"]


Step 2. The user executes `delete r 5` command to delete the 5th request in request book. The `delete r` command calls `Model#commit(REQUEST_COMMAND)`, causing the modified state of the request book after the `delete r 5` command executes to be saved in the `requestBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted request book state.
Since the request book is modified, the enum `REQUEST_COMMAND` is added to the `modifyCommandHistory` list within the `ModifyCommandHistory` class and the `currentStatePointer` is now pointing at the most recent command.
The `VersionedHealthWorkerBook` is unaffected.

image::rbafterdelete.png[width="800"]
image::mchafterdelete.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add h n/David ...` to add a new healthworker. The `add h` command also calls `Model#commit(HEALTHWORKER_COMMAND)`, causing a modified health worker book state to be saved into the `healthWorkerBookStateList` and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the new health worker book state.
The enum `HEALTHWORKER_COMMAND` is added into the `modifyCommandHistory` list of the `ModifyCommandHistory` class.
The `VersionedRequestBook` is unaffected.

image::hbafteradd.png[width="800"]
image::mchafteradd.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commit()`, so the book state will not be saved into the `healthWorkerBookStateList` or `requestBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the health worker was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command.
The `undo` command will call `Model#undo()`, which will first obtain the type of command that needs to be undone by caling  `ModifyCommandHistory#getUndoCommand()`. In this case `HEALTHWORKER_COMMAND` is returned, and hence will call undo on `VersionedHealthWorkerBook`. It will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous health worker book state, and restores the health worker book to that state.
The `currentStatePointer` of the `ModifyCommandHistory` also gets shifted once to the left, pointing it to the previous command.

image::hbafterundo.png[width="800"]
image::mchafterundo.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` of both `VersionedHealthWorkerBook` and `VersionedRequestBook` is at index 0, pointing to the initial book state for both books, then there are no previous states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSeqDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redo()`, which first obtains the command type by calling `ModifyCommandHistory#getRedoCommand()` and based on the returned command type it shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the respective book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` of both `VersionedBook` s are pointing to the latest state, then there are no undone book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list r`. Commands that do not modify the books, such as `list r`,
will not call `Model#commit()`, `Model#undo()` or `Model#redo()`. Thus, the `VersionedBook` s and `ModyfiCommandHistory` do not change.

image::rbafterlist.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `delete h 1`, which calls `Model#commit(HEALTHWORKER_COMMAND)`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `healthWorkerBookStateList`, all health worker book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged.
We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::hbafterdel.png[width="800"]
image::mchafteroverride.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations


===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes
[width="100%",cols="1, 5, 5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
Implementation |Saves the entire book (Current implementation) | Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
|Pros| Less prone to bugs since the we are switching between different versions of the books. | Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
|Cons| May have performance issues in terms of memory usage especially for
large numbers of health workers and requests.| Every command will have their own implementation of undo and some of them are slow hence it causes performance issues.
(e.g. for `clr`, all requests that were deleted have to be added back into the list, which will be quite slow if
there is a large number of requests).|
|=======================================================================


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands
[width="100%",cols="1, 5, 5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
Implementation | Use a list to store the history of book states.(Current implementation) | Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
|Pros|  Undo and redo commands runs faster since it only involves the switching of the state pointer.| Supports multiple books with the `HistoryManager` alone since we are undoing from the command history.
|Cons| Need multiple `VersionedBook` s. One or each type of book.|  `HistoryManager` keeps a record of all commands, even if they are invalid or commands that does not call `Model#commit()`.
Traversing these irrelevant commands to find the next undoable command will take a long time especially if size of history is large.|
|=======================================================================

===== Aspect: Data structure to handle multiple `VersionedBooks`
[width="100%",cols="1, 5, 5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
Implementation | Use a command history to keep track
of the type of book that was modified It is represented as a list of `CommandType`.(Current implementation) | Use a list of pairs. Each state is represented as a pair which stores the `currentStatePointer` of each book.
|Pros| Easily scalable to include more than two books. As the developer can simply add an extra `CommandType`
and extra cases for switch statements.| Supports commands that change multiple books at once since it keeps track of all states.
|Cons| Unable to handle commands that change multiple books at once. We assume that only one `currentStatePointer` can change per undo/redo.| Keeping a multiple integers takes up more memory as compared to keeping a single enum.
|=======================================================================

// end::undoredo[]

// tag::setreminder[]
=== Set Reminder Feature

The `setreminder` command gives the user an option to set a reminder with a customised message.
The reminder is in the form of an `AlertDialog` and is scheduled to show on the UI by a `TimerTask` at time
`t + current time`. +

The alert only pop ups when the application is running in the background.
// end::setreminder[]


=== Get Statistics Feature

The `statistics` command gives the user the ability to view the health conditions and their respective number of
occurrences shown in the display panel in descending order, as shown in the picture below.

image::statistics_command_desc.png[]

The statistics are stored in a TreeMap data structure, ensuring consistently efficient run time when computing
statistics for each individual health condition.

Since the statistics are only derived from existing requests, if there are no requests for homecare added on HealthHub,
an error message will be shown: `Conditions and their related occurrences are not available`, as shown below

image::empty_statistics.PNG[]

// tag::autocomplete[]
=== Autocomplete Feature for CommandBox
The UI component, `CommandBox`, comes with a `TextField` component in AB4. For Health Hub, the `TextField` is replaced
with an `AutoCompleteTextField` class that extends from the parent class, `TextField`.

In the `AutoCompleteTextField` class, it adds an additional listener to the `textProperty()` of `TextField` class, to register for when
a text input is being sensed and generates the suggestion box in the form of a `ContextMenu` to the user.

The searching of which commands to display to the user as suggestions is by iterating the `suggestions` data structure, which is a `TreeSet`, then checking
against the user's input if any of the suggestions starts with the user's text.

==== Aspect: Data structure to store the list of commands
<insert text>

==== Aspect: Algorithm to search for commands that fit user's input
<insert text>

A detailed interaction diagram for the autocomplete behaviour is created previously under <insert section>.
// end::autocomplete[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`

=== Generation of test files

We use classes located in the `seedu.address.jsonfilegenerator` folder to generate JSON
test files. +
Developers are free to modify the code within the classes to generate healthworker/request
book containing the respective data they need for tests by using the `HealthWorkerBuilder`
 and `RequestBuilder` classes +
All test file generator classes contains a main function and hence can be ran independently by compiling the file.



=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
