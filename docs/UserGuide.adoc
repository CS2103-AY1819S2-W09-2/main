== Introduction

HealthHub connects home care patients to qualified health care professionals seamlessly.

HealthHub is a desktop application which allows health administrative staff to add, manage and close requests from
patients. These patients are people who do not require 24-hour round' the clock medical attention but perhaps some
other health care services such as the changing of tubing. +

HealthHub provides a *Graphical User Interface* for administrative staff of health organizations and hospitals to manage requests
from all potential home stay patients, and is also *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI). +

Want to jump right into using HealthHub? Head over to <<Quick Start>> to
install and configure the application, and you're good to go!

== Notation

* Words that are highlighted with a grey background in monospaced font
represent a `parameter` or `command` that is present or are to be used in the
application.

* All numbers mentioned with commands begins with the number 1, representing the first item in the list.

* Words that are highlighted in white represent a kbd:[keyboard] button that
can be pressed to invoke a described function.

== ChangeLog

Returning user but not sure what has changed since you left?

Listed below are the enhancements made to HealthHub, their version
 releases and the respective improvement made:

=== v1.1 Release Notes

In this patch, the functionality to register new health workers into the
application has been implemented. Users may now also add new requests from
patients into Health Hub for future assignment using the `assign` command.

* `add healthworker` command: Adds a health worker to the application, for
future assignment to open requests in HealtHub. For details on the
* `add request` command: Registers a new open request into the application.
The open request can then be assigned by the user using the `assign` command.

For more explicit information on the `add` command, visit <<Features>>,
under Adding a Health Worker/Request.

* `assign` command: Assigns an open request to an available health worker
that is already registered in the system

=== v1.2 Release Notes

Version 1.2 provides more utility to the application through the
implementation of the `edit` and `delete` command that allows the user to
modify and remove requests and health workers from the application.

* `edit healthworker/h/1`: Modifies the details of an existing health staff
registered in HealthHub.
* `edit request/r/2`: Modifies the details of existing request records in the
 application.

For more explicit information on the `edit` command, visit <<Features>>,
under Editing a Health Worker/Request.

=== v1.3 Release Notes

With the release of version 1.3, we have set out to improve the already
simple and easy to use HealthHub with command shortcuts, as well as `filter`
command to easily search for staff with the skillset you are looking for.

*Shortcuts*:

* `add healthworker/h/1`: Adds a health worker to the application.
* `add request/r/2`: Registers a new request for the hospital management to attend to.

*Filtering requests and health workers*:

* `filter healthworker/h/1`: Filters a healthworker by the individual's name, phone, organisation or
specialisation.
* `filter request/r/2`: Filters a request by the patient's name, address, or the
date and time of the request and the status of the request

Other enhancements made to HealthHub include:

* `setreminder` command: Allows the user to set and register reminders in the
 application.
* `undo/redo` command: Undo a previous action or redo everything.

For more explicit information on the `filter`,`setreminder` and `undo/redo`
command, visit <<Features>>, under Filtering Health Workers/Requests.

[[Features]]
== Features

The following description of the features and commands are prototypes and specific details and implementation may vary over the course of the project.

*General Command Format*:

* Words in `<conditions>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/<name>`, `<name>` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/<name> [c/<condition>]`
can be used as `n/John Doe c/Claustrophobia` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `s/<specialisation>...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/<name> p/<phone_number>`, `p/<phonenumber> n/<name>` is also acceptable.

=== Viewing Help : `help`

Upon first starting the application as a new user, or perhaps a returning
user, you may open up the help menu using the `help` command.

Upon entering the `help` command, the help menu renders separately from the
HealthHub main application. Therefore, you do not have to worry about losing
any existing work on HealthHub when you are viewing the help menu!

Format: `help`

The help menu displays a list of available commands for HealthHub, their
parameters and their functions. Should you ever forget the commands for
HealthHub, feel free to enter the `help` command to revisit this guide.


// tag::listHealthWorker[]
=== Showing all requests/health workers : `list`

The `list` command is a simple and basic command that on entering, displays
all health workers/requests in the HealthHub GUI.

Format: `list <type>`

==== Showing all health workers

Format: `list healthworker/h/1`

Upon entering the command to list health workers, all currently registered
health workers in the Health Hub system will be displayed on the list on the
right side of the GUI.
// end::listHealthWorker[]

==== Showing all requests

Format: `list request/r/2`

After entering the command to list requests, you should see the list on the
left side of the GUI being populated with all requests that are added to
HealthHub.

[TIP]
====
This command may be useful for users to identify existing personnel,
patients or requests in the system before assigning and closing existing
requests for specific health services.
====

Example:

* `list healthworker/h/1` lists all health workers stored in the system,
their personal particulars, and their skills in the healthcare field.
* `list request/r/2` lists all requests stored in the system, as well as the
details of the request such as the patient to tend to, the date and time of
the request and the type of service requested.

// tag::addHealthWorker[]
=== Adding requests/health workers: `add`

Before you can jump right into the core feature of our application and
streamline the process of adding requests from patients and to assign
requests to experts in the medical field, it is essential to first ensure
that the respective health staff and patients are registered in the system
with all the key information.

Add a request, health worker or patient to the application based on the
`<type>` parameter accepted, using the `add` command, to register new health
staff, patients and requests. +

Format: `add <type> <additional_parameters>...` +

==== *Adding a health worker*: `add healthworker/h/1 n/<worker_name> i/<NRIC> n/<phone_number> s/<specialisation>...`

* Command that registers a new Health Worker person to the current roster.
* Health Workers comprises of personnel who are authorized to work in sectors in the
healthcare industry in accordance to their `specialisation`.
* Health Workers authorized for medical practice specific to their
`specialisation` include doctors, nurses and community health workers that
are officially certified by certain medical practices
* To view all available specialisations in the application, type `add help`
in the command line.
// end::addHealthWorker[]

==== *Adding a request*: `add request/r/2 n/<patient_name> c/<condition> d/<date> t/time`

* Registers a new open request from `patient` of `<patient_name>` into the
application.
* Each request also states the `<condition>` that the patient is
experiencing. Administrative staff can then inspect the conditions that are
stated by the `patient` and assign the appropriate health worker to handle
these requests in the `assign` command.
* Format for the time is `HH:mm:ss`.
* Format for the date is `dd-MM-yyyy`.

Examples:

* `add 1 n/Dog Terr p/92837710 i/S98817471Z s/GENERAL_PRACTICE
s/ORTHOPAEDIC`
* `add request n/Pay Shun c/Heart Attack t/14:00:00 d/05:05:2019`

// tag::editHealthWorker[]
=== Editing requests/health workers : `edit`

Sometimes, information on a request of health staff may be keyed in wrongly
into the application, or you may need to update existing outdated information.

To do this, you can replace the current information
with the new one using the `edit` command to modify existing personnel
records or request descriptions in HealthHub.

The `edit` may come in handy when there is a need update to a request's
status, patient's condition or a health worker's skills, based on the
`<type>` parameter accepted. +

==== *Editing a health worker*

Format: `edit healthworker/h/1 <index> <additional_parameters>...`

Edits the details of an existing health worker registered in HealthHub, at
the `<index>` specified in the health worker list upon entering the `edit
healthworker/h/1` command with valid inputs.
// end::editHealthWorker[]

==== *Editing a request*

Format: `edit request/r/2 <index> <additional_parameters>...`

Edits the details of a request registered in HealthHub, at
the `<index>` specified in the request list upon entering the `edit
request/r/2` command with valid inputs.

Upon entering the `edit` command with all the necessary and valid paramters,
the corresponding request/health worker at the specified `<index>`. The index refers to the
index number shown in the displayed person list.

Existing values of the health worker or request will be updated to the valid
input values based on the prefix specified.

Any changes made to existing fields in requests and healthworkers are
immediately reflected in the list shown on the HealthHub GUI.

{nbsp}

*Notes*:

* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
and not greater than the number of requests/health workers/patients in the current list.

* Apart from `specialisations` in health workers and `condition` in
patients, each field can only have a single value and multiple edit values
for other fields will only cause the last one to be accepted.

[NOTE]
====
When editing specialisations for health workers, the existing specialisations
 of the person will be removed i.e adding of specialisation is not cumulative.
====

[TIP]
====
You can remove all the person's specialisation by typing `s/` without
specifying any parameters after it.
====

Examples:

* `edit healthworker 1 p/91234567 n/John Doe` +
Edits the phone number and name of the 1st health worker shown in the health
worker list to be `91234567` and `John Doe` respectively. +
* `edit request 2 n/Betsy Crower` +
Edits the patient name of the 2nd request in the request list to be `Betsy
Crower`. +

// tag::filterHealthWorker[]
=== Filtering health workers/requests: `filter`

When identifying health workers to assign to an open request, or
to look for a particular patient details in certain requests, it may be useful
 to only display items in a list that match a particular constraint.

Using the `filter` command, you can set the GUI to display health workers and
requests whose fields match the `keywords`that are specified in the `filter`
command, allowing you to find the doctors who are experts in cardiology much quicker. +

Format: `filter <type> <keyword> [<more_keywords>]...` +

==== *Filter health workers*:

Format: `filter healthworker/h/1 <keyword> [<more_keywords>]`

Upon entering the command with valid inputs, searches the entire list of health
workers in HealthHub, and only displays the health workers whose fields matches the parameters specified in the
`filter` command.

[NOTE]
====
For specialisation fields, parameters are case sensitive, and only valid
parameters will be accepted
====
// end::filterHealthWorker[]

==== *Filter requests*:

Format: `filter request/r/2 <keyword> [<more_keywords>]`

After entering the command with valid inputs, searches the entire list of
requests in HealthHub, and only displays the requests whose fields matches
 the parameters specified in the
`filter` command.

{nbsp}

where `<more_keywords>` represents the fields and parameters that can be used to
identify requests or personnel, using the same prefixes as in `add`, `edit` and
`delete` commands. Some examples of keywords are shown below.

*Notes*:

* The search is *case insensitive* for all fields apart from specialisation(e.g
`hans` will match `Hans`), and the *order of the keywords* does not matter(e.g
`Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`).

* Search using partial words will return all results with fields containing
that subword. (e.g `filter 1 n/Tan` may return people with the surnames Tan or
Tang)

{nbsp}

[TIP]
====
Multiple conditions for filtering health workers and requests can be added
simultaneously for more expressive search.

Example:

`filter r n/<name> p/<phone>`
filters the request list for requests whose patient's name contains the
specified name substring *and* the specified phone number.
====

[TIP]
====
To revert the view back to the original health worker/request list, enter the
`list healthworker` or `list request` command respectively.
====

Examples:

* `filter h s/GENERAL_PRACTICE s/GYNAECOLOGY` +
Returns all health workers whose field of expertise include general practice
or gynaecology.
* `filter request n/alice` +
Returns all patients whose name contains "alice".
* `filter r p/9177` +
Returns all requests with contacts numbers that have "9177" in it's field.
* `filter 2 dt/30-01-2019 10:00:00` +
Returns all requests scheduled on 30th Jan 2019, at 10 am sharp.

// tag::delHealthWorker[]
=== Deleting requests/health workers : `delete`

Should there be any invalid or expired request, health worker or patient in
the application, you may also remove them to prevent cluttering of
unnecessary data by using the `delete` command to remove them from the
application based on the`<type>` parameter accepted, according to the
index of the respective `type`
shown using the `list` command, or the index displayed on the GUI. +

Format: `delete <type> <index>` +

==== *Delete a health worker*:

Format: `delete healthworker/h/1 <index>`

Deletes the health worker at the `<index>` position in shown in the health
worker list.
// end::delHealthWorker[]

==== *Delete a request*:

Format: `delete request/r/2 <index>`

Deletes the request at the `<index>` position in shown in the list of requests.

*Notes*:

* Deletes the corresponding request/health worker/patient at the specified `<index>`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed request/health
worker/patient list using the `list` command, or displayed through the GUI.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ... and not greater
than the number of requests/health workers/patients in the current list.

Examples:

* `delete healthworker 2` +
Deletes the 2nd health worker registered in the list of healthworkers in
HealthHub.

* `delete request 1` +
Deletes the 1st request as shown in the list of requests on the GUI of the
application

[TIP]
====
Accidentally deleted the wrong health worker or request? Don't worry, the
deletion can be undone using the `undo` command as long as the application is
 still running.

To undo the most recent `delete` command entered by entering the `undo`
command immediately after the previous `delete` command to undo the deletion.
====

=== Assigning health workers to an open request : `assign`

After registering a new request using the `add request/r/2` command, you may
proceed to assign an existing health worker in the system to handle the request,
 allocating medical resources to it and closing the request using the simple
 `assign` command +

Format: `assign <request_index> <health_worker_index>`

Where the `<request_index>` and `<health_worker_index>` are as shown in the
respective health worker and requests lists in the HealthHub GUI.

*Notes*:

* The `request_index` and `health_worker_index` fields *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ... and not greater
than the number of requests/health workers in the current list.
* Health worker that is assigned must be available at the current time stated by the request.
* Health worker must have the necessary skillset and certifications that allow him to be able to take up the corresponding request.

Examples:

* `assign 1 2` +
Assigns the health worker at the second index to the first request in the
request list.

=== Clearing Requests : `clr`

After closing all existing requests, you also have the option of clearing all
 requests from the request list, regardless of the state of the request, upon
  entering the `clr` command.

Format: `clr`

[WARNING]
====
Clearing requests would delete all records of completed requests.

If you would like to delete just one particular request, consider using the
`delete` command instead.
====

=== Closing Requests : `complete`

After an assigned task has been completed by the assigned health staff, who
has administered the necessary medical treatment, you can mark the request as
 closed, using the `complete` command.

Format: `complete <request_index>`

Upon entering the `complete` command, you should notice the status of the
request at position `<request_index>` changed to `COMPLETED`, marking the
request closed.

*Notes*:

* The `request_index` *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ... and not greater
than the number of requests in the current list.

Examples:

* `complete 1` +
Marks the first request in the list as completed.

=== Listing previous commands : `history`

In the case where you have been using the application for a while now, and
wish to track and see the past commands that you have entered into the
application, or where you have taken over the application from another
person, you can do so using the `history` command. +

Using the `history` command, you can view the previous commands entered in
the application in chronological order, allowing you to identify the order in
 which commands are keyed in previously.

Format: `history` +

Upon keying in the `history` command, a log of recent commands in order of
decreasing timestamp(earliest to latest) will appear on the terminal as shown
 below:

image::history_command.png[]

[NOTE]
====
Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
====


=== Viewing a request : `sr`

With the flexibility in managing and adding, editing and deleting requests,
existing functionality for the user to view the details of requests in
HealthHub has also been implemented to improve the user experience.

Format: `sr <request_index>`

Entering the `sr` command allows the application to select the request at the
 specified `<request_index>`, and displays the full details of the selected
 request on the GUI.

[TIP]
====
Users also have the option of clicking on a request in the request list on
the GUI, which automatically selects the clicked request as the displayed
request.
====

=== Setting Reminder Alerts: `setreminder`

Sometimes, it can be difficult to keep track of multiple tasks and specific
details for different requests. In addition to the already expressive
function of keying in the description of a request upon registering, the
`setreminder` command now also allows you to set customised reminder alerts
to aid you so that you do not have to cram a large amount of details in memory.

Format: `setreminder t/<hh:mm:ss> m/<customised_message>` +

Using the `setreminder` command, you can register a reminder message in
HealthHub with your own customised message as well as date and time, that
automatically alerts you by displaying the entered message 5 minutes before the
chosen date and time.

As in the example below, a reminder has been set to go off at 6:00AM with
the customised message to "to call patient John Doe for his appointment".

image::reminder_command.png[]

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Once you are done using the application, you can exit the application by
entering the `exit` command, hereby saving any information at the current
point in time before shutting down. +

Format: `exit`

=== Saving the data

All application data are saved in the hard disk automatically after exiting
the application, removing the need to save manually. +

Changes to the data in the application are also saved that any command that
modifies application parameters, making sure that minimal data is lost should
any unforeseen circumstances happen.
