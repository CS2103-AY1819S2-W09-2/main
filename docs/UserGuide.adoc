== Introduction

AddressBook Level 4 (AB4) is a application that allows users to add, manage and close requests from patients for health services. AB4 provides a *Graphical User Interface* for administrative staff of health organization and hospitals to manage requests from all potential home stay patients, and is also *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI). +
Looking to improve and ease management of requests from cusomters and patients? Look no further, AB4 provides all the utility and functions you need to streamline your workflow. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Additional installation guides will be added further into the project.

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all requests
* **`add`**`i/3 n/John Doe p/98765432 a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a patient named `John Doe` to the application.
* **`delete`**`t/R n/4` : deletes the 4th request shown by the list command
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

Note that the current application is a work in progress. The following description of the features and commands are prototypes and specific details and implementation may vary over the course of the project.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `<tags>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/<name>`, `<name>` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/<name> [s/<specialisation>]` can be used as `n/John Doe s/Gynaecology` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[s/<specialisation>]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/<name> p/<phone_number>`, `p/<phonenumber> n/<name>` is also acceptable.

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

Lists all available commands, their parameters and their function.

=== Listing all requests/health workers/patients : `list`

* `list 2` lists all health workers stored in the system, and the skills and certifications they posses

=== Adding a request/health worker/patient: `add`

Format: `add <type> <additional_parameters>...` +
Types:

* 1: Adding a request `add 1 n/<patient_name> c/<condition> d/<date> t/time`
* 2: Adding a health worker `add 2 n/<worker_name> i/<NRIC> n/<phone_number> s/<specialisation>...`
* 3: Adding a patient `add 3 n/<patient_name> i/<NRIC> n/<phone_number>`

Examples:

* `add 1 n/Lucas Choong c/Arthritis d/05/02/2019 t/1400`
