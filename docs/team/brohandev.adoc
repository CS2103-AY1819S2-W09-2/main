== Introduction

Hello there! I am Rohan Dev, a Year 2 Computer Science undergraduate from the National University of Singapore (NUS).
This portfolio documents the contributions I have made to Project HealthHub over the course of an academic semester.
HealthHub has exposed me to making contributions to a pre-existing code base and morphing it into a desktop application
of our choice. I have picked up many relevant skills and software engineering principles en route to completing this
project.

== HealthHub

=== Problem needing to be solved

With the number of elderly slated to reach 900,000 by 2030 resulting in an increasing need for Intermediate and
Long-Term Care (ILTC) services, it comes as no surprise that the amount of documentation for these patients is also
increasing rapidly. Furthermore, from our research, it had been brought to our attention that almost all records for
homecare patients are being done on pen and paper, resulting in slower assignment of homecare jobs to the health
professionals. The hospital administrative staff we spoke to even mentioned that the excessive paperwork contributes to
an excessive number of binders being used and a permanent state of chaos and clutter on their desks. My team and I saw
this as an opportunity to really come up with something relevant and helpful to the healthcare scene in Singapore and
thus, HealthHub was born.

== Brief Overview of HealthHub

HealthHub is a robust desktop application designed to be a centralized platform for hospital administrative staff to
efficiently manage the assignment of health workers (doctors/nurses/volunteers with relevant certification) to homecare
patients and monitor their statuses at their respective jobs. The digitization of the homecare job assignment process
significantly reduces paperwork and allows for far more organization of information.

HealthHub users interact through the Command Line Interface (CLI) and receive visual feedback through a User Interface
(UI) created with JavaFX. It is written in Java. The features and implementations are well documented in guides for
users and developers respectively. HealthHub has been well maintained with high code quality and coverage as it is
covered by rigorous tests and checks.

=== My Role

My role was to facilitate the computation and display of statistics related to the occurrences of all health conditions
on the HealthHub platform. Since the statistics feature needs to calculate each health condition’s frequency across all
users on HealthHub, I also constructed the base Java class for Condition, such that the administrator can type in a
patient’s health condition or homecare requirement (for e.g. ‘Cancer’, ‘Palliative’, ‘Physiotherapy’ and more) when
adding a request for homecare, and the statistics feature adds to its specific number of occurrences. In addition, I
wrote rigorous tests and test utilities to ensure reliability and simple maintenance.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Adding the *ability to view the most common health conditions* amongst patients registered on HealthHub

** *What it does*: allows the administrative staff to call for the frequencies of all health conditions registered on HealthHub. It can also call the frequency of a specific health condition in descending order. Calling the statistics command specific to a particular condition will likewise display the number of occurrences of that health condition.
** *Justification*: It is imperative for the health administrators to know which health conditions have been seeing an increasing trend, as well as take note of those which have been experiencing a decline. Upon collating such data, the administrative staff can feedback and make suggestions to the hospital to increase or decrease training in certain departments. The staff can even suggest to the government to ramp up efforts in its Work Skills Qualification certification for certain healthcare skills to be taught to new aspiring healthcare professionals.
** *Highlights*: The statistics feature needs to be able to ensure that the administrative staff can extract relevant information as fast as possible. Therefore, the TreeMap data structure was used to contain all occurrences of health conditions on HealthHub for the best overall performance for speed. I have had to overcome the difficulty of having to coordinate with all HealthHub commands and sync my statistical data with the data in the application. For example, when the `undo` command is made, my statistics data must also go back to the state prior to the `undo` call.

* *Minor enhancement*: Incorporated a patient’s set of health conditions into requests for home care.

** *What it does*: When adding a request for home care in HealthHub, instead of merely typing in 1 health condition per request, the administrative staff can now add in a set of all health conditions the particular patient may suffer from.
** *Justification*: Health practitioners, before attempting treatment on any patient, would want to know all health conditions the particular patient might be suffering from. There have been plenty of cases in the past where the administered treatment by the health care professional on a patient had triggered other health conditions in the patient, which the healthcare professionals were completely unaware of. Therefore, instead of just adding a request for a particular treatment, administrators can add a request with multiple health conditions.
** *Highlights*: When the administrator adds a request for home care on the HealthHub platform, it takes in all the patient’s particulars (name, NRIC, phone number, home address) and a set of health conditions the patient suffers from. I made use of the hashset data structure to contain the set of health conditions inside it for each patient. The set of conditions guarantees no duplicate health condition being found inside and it can also speedily access any specific health condition the administrative staff may be looking for or may be interested in for further investigation.

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Setup codacy and coveralls badges for the team on GitHub
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Wrote Conditions class based off Tag class from Address Book 4, and incorporated additional functionality for it to accept more than just 1 string input.
*** Wrote tests for Condition class and condition-related features in Request class, including various test utility classes to assist other team members in their testing
** Documentation:
*** Added detailed implementation documentation for the statistics feature in the User Guide and the Developer Guide, including diagrams
** Community:
*** Reviewed and gave feedback to team members. PRs reviewed: https://github.com[#80], https://github.com[#107], https://github.com[#142]
** Tools:
*** Setup Codacy and Coveralls badges to perform automated testing of test cases and auto-publishing of documentation and reports on overall overage score of the application software.
