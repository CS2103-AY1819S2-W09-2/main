== Overview
I am a software developer and second year computer science student at the National University of Singapore. I am really passionate about developing technology that can make the world a better place. This portfolio page documents my contributions to one of the most meaningful projects I've worked for - HealthHub.

== Project: Health Hub

=== About the project
HealthHub is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface[command-line] desktop application built by my team and I, for our Software Engineering project.
We chose to morph it to a home-care patient management system, because of our passion in the health care industry. This enhanced application allows Hospital Administrators and senior management to create, assign and organise patient records seamlessly. HealhHub also organises staff information and manages statistics to assist in the Hospital's planning and allocation of resources.

My role was to design and implement the [blue]`Request` related commands and features. This included designing the relevant encapsulation within a [blue]`Request` created by the user and creating the following commands from scratch: `add`, `edit`, `list`, `delete`, `clear`, `assign`, `complete` and `filter`. The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant sections that I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

Note the following symbols and formatting used in this document:

`add` A grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the application.
[blue]`Request` Blue text with a grey highlight indicates a component, class or object in the architecture of the application.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Created `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `list`, `clear` commands.
** What it does: Lays the foundation to any `Request` based functionality. Allows the user to organise the requests made by the patients seamlessly.
** Justification: These enhancements provide necessary features to the admin so that the admin can create, edit or delete requests at any point of time.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects the existing existing classes, like the [blue]`Healthworker` class. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation was also challenging as it required changes to existing commands and classes, during the integration-testing phase.
** Credits: Utilised the JACKSon library that serializes a [blue]`Request` object into JSON format for storage. This allows the user's state to be saved at all times.

* *Major enhancement*: Created `assign` and `complete` request commands.
** What it does: Allows the admin to assign Healthworkers to requests, and complete any ongoing requests.
** Justification: These features are necessary for the product, and allows the administrator manage all patient requests by assigning the relevant healthworker with the appropriate skill sets.
** Highlights: Creation of these features required thorough understanding of how the existing details of the [blue]`Logic` and [blue]`Model` components,
as knowledge of how information is cached in the application's memory was essential to allow for rapid assigning. Implemented index-based assigning, which improved effeciency
 by 30% (each `assign` request command runs in O(1) time).

* *Minor enhancement*: added a filter command that allows the user to navigate through all requests stored by filtering by a specific value.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub
*** Added reposense compatibility
*** Added coveralls compatibility to project README
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests https://github.com[#36], https://github.com[#38])
** Documentation:
*** Did cosmetic tweaks to existing contents of the User Guide: https://github.com[#14]
** Community:
*** PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): https://github.com[#12], https://github.com[#32], https://github.com[#19], https://github.com[#42]
*** Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3])
*** Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates (https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2])

=== Assign Request feature

The assign request feature allows an administrator to assign a request to a particular healthworker.

==== Current Implementation

The following sequence diagram shows the sequence flow from the `LogicManager` to the `ModelManager` when a user enters a `assign request` command:

Figure 3.3.1.1 Sequence diagram to illustrate `Logic` component interactions for `assign request` command.

Figure 3.3.1.2 Sequence diagram to illustrate `Logic` and `Model` component interactions for [blue]`AssignRequestCommand`.

1. When `LogicManager` receives the `execute` command, it calls the `parseCommand` method in `RequestBookParser`.
2. `RequestBookParser` will receive `assign` as the command and instantiate `AssignRequestCommandParser` to further parse the command.
3. If the arguments specified in the `assign` command are invalid, a `AssignCommand` will be created and returned back to the `LogicManager`.
4. `LogicManager` will proceed to call the `execute` command of `AssignCommand`
5. `AssignRequestCommand` will proceed to call the `getFilteredRequestList` method of `Model`.
6. Iterate through the `requestIds`, if valid, add the `request` corresponding to that `index` to the set of `Request`.
7. Writes the updated request to the `RequestBook` in `ModelManager`

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Relationship between `Request` and `Healthworker`
* Alternative 1 (current choice): The `Request` holds only some of the details of the healthworker (e.g name) assigned to it.
** Pros: Simplification of implementation.
** Pros: Cleaner implementation, low level of dependencies on other modules. This also makes it easier to test, and easier to maintain.
** Cons: Makes it difficult to obtain all details of a healthworker from a `Request` object.

* Alternative 2: The `Request` holds a `HealthWorker` object and the `HealthWorker` keeps track of a list of `Request`s.
** Pros: Can quickly access details of a `HealthWorker` from a `Request`, and can quickly access the `Requests` assigned to a `HealthWorker` from the `Request`.
** Cons: Increases complexity of code base, adding additional dependencies to the code. This makes the code base more verbose and less maintainable
